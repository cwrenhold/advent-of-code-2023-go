# Introduction

This is a little late to the party, however, I wanted to play around with some Go, and I figured what better way to do that than run through some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

# Setup

This project is using Go 1.22, and using a devcontainer if you're used to using things like that. This was initially created using [nvim-dev-container](https://codeberg.org/esensar/nvim-dev-container), and I'd recommend using that if you want to look around this project. This isn't set up to work with vscode's devcontainer, but this project should be very simple and not really need that if you have Go installed locally.
