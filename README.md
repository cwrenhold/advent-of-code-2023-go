# Introduction

This is a little late to the party, however, I wanted to play around with some Go, and I figured what better way to do that than run through some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

# Setup

This project is using Go 1.22, and using a devcontainer if you're used to using things like that. For more information, I would recommend the following resources:

- [devcontainer cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) - This is a CLI for running dev containers.
- [devc-nvim-commands](https://github.com/cwrenhold/devc-nvim-commands) - My own script to make it easier to use dev containers with neovim.
